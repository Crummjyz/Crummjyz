Hi. I'm Crummjyz *(aka Crummjys, /krʌmdʒeɪz/)*.  
I'm a New Zealand highschool student interested in code, design, rockets, and 
science in general. Together with my friends I work on projects over at 
[fantail.dev](https://fantail.dev). For more detailed info on projects, check 
out [crummjyz.github.io](https://crummjyz.github.io), or email me at 
[crummjys@fantail.dev](mailto:crummjys@fantail.dev).
